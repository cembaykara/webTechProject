You can find our mapper robot and runner robot in seperate folders.
Dependencies and robot model files are in a seperate folder.

--------------------------------  DISCLAIMER  --------------------------------  

1. There are two programs. One for running the robot and one for mapping the maze.
You should first run maze mapper and then feed the output to the runner program.
Upon completion the mapping the program will ask you to save the coordinates file
which you should then give to the runner program when asked.

2. We found that the sweet spot for the runner programm is when;

		VELOCITY		: 3.5
		TOLERANCE		: 0.1
		ROT TOLERANCE 	: 2

3. Since they are two different LabView programs, the dependencies may give some errors.
To solve them replace the subVI's with the ones from the dependencies folder.
